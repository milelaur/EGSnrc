## What is EGSnrc?

EGSnrc is a software toolkit to perform Monte Carlo simulation of ionizing
radiation transport through matter. It models the propagation of photons,
electrons and positrons with kinetic energies between 1 keV and 10 GeV, in
homogeneous materials. EGSnrc was originally released in 2000, as a complete
overhaul of the Electron Gamma Shower (EGS) software package originally
developed at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in the 1970s. Most
notably, EGSnrc incorporates crucial refinements in charged particle transport,
better low energy cross sections, and the egs++ class library to model
elaborate geometries and particle sources.

## Licence

EGSnrc is distributed as free software under the terms of the GNU Affero
General Public Licence. Please review the
[LICENCE](https://github.com/nrc-cnrc/EGSnrc/blob/master/LICENCE.md) document
before downloading the software. In practice, this licence imposes no
restriction on using EGSnrc. However, if you want to further convey
verbatim or modified versions of the code, or any work based on any
EGSnrc component (including any such work operated remotely over a
network), you must do so under the same licence terms.
[Contact NRC](https://nrc.canada.ca/en/research-development/products-services/software-applications/egsnrc-software-tool-model-radiation-transport)
if you wish to licence EGSnrc under different terms.


## Prerequisites

EGSnrc can be installed on computers running Linux, macOS or Windows
operating systems. As a general-purpose Monte Carlo toolkit, EGSnrc
provides source code and utilities to build and run your own
radiation transport simulation applications. To use EGSnrc
on any platform you need:

- a Fortran compiler
- a C compiler
- a C++ compiler
- the GNU `make` utility
- the Tcl/Tk interpreter and widget toolkit (optional, for GUIs)
- the Grace plotting tool (optional, for plotting data)

Please read the
[installation instructions](https://github.com/nrc-cnrc/EGSnrc/wiki/Installation-overview) in the
wiki for more details about these software components.


## Installation

Installation involves downloading the EGSnrc source code, and then configuring
EGSnrc for your computer. We recommend using the `git` version control
system to obtain the source code. The following shell command will clone the
EGSnrc repository to your current working directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nrc-cnrc/EGSnrc.git
```

Alternatively, you can download a
[zip archive](https://github.com/nrc-cnrc/EGSnrc/archive/master.zip) of the EGSnrc
directory. Once you have downloaded the source code, you need to run a
configuration GUI or script to set up and compile EGSnrc software components
for your computer. Please read the full
[installation instructions](https://github.com/nrc-cnrc/EGSnrc/wiki/Installation-overview)
for more details on how to download and configure EGSnrc.
